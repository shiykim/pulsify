# Pulsify README

[Pulsify](https://pulsify-app.herokuapp.com/) was inspired by Spotify, a music streaming service with over 180 million users. Similarly to Spotify, Pulsify features continuous playback, artist profiles, and playlist creation, all culminating in a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used
* Pulsify was created with Rails on the backend using a Postgresql database and React/Redux on the frontend.
* Images and MP3s were stored using AWS S3, lightening the local storage load increasing scalability.
* The loading time of the app was also optimized through jBuilder and Rails' Active Storage which made for a more cohesive experience for the user.
